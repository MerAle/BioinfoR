 Download Zika virus (NC_012532.1).  Fit its genoma sequence to a Markov chain model, estimating its transition probability matrix.

- Take the sequence of Dengue virus (NC_001477) from position 101 to 200 (this is a chunk of length 100). Suppose now that you don’t know whether this sequence belongs to Zica or Dengue virus (of course, you know it!). Decide using the log-likelihood method to which virus this sequence belongs.

-  Fit the Zica virus sequence to a two second order Markov chain model. Compare the results with respect a simple Markov chain model.  

       Please, comment the results and be creative!
